Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) are two
 paradigms of programming that are used to structure and organize code.

Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) focuses on writing procedures or functions 
that perform specific tasks. These procedures are organized into modules, which 
can be called from other parts of the program. The emphasis is on breaking down
 a large problem into smaller, manageable procedures that can be easily understood 
 and modified. POP is often used for small, simple programs, and it is generally easier 
 to learn and understand than OOP.

On the other hand, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based
 on the concept of objects. Objects are instances of classes, which are essentially templates
  or blueprints that describe the attributes and behavior of a type of real-world object. OOP 
  emphasizes the organization of code into objects that interact with each other to solve 
  problems. This allows for the creation of reusable code, which can be easily maintained and 
  extended over time. OOP is commonly used for large, complex applications, such as video games
   or web applications.

In OOP, data and behavior are encapsulated in an object, making it easier to understand and 
manage the relationships between different parts of the program. OOP also provides features 
such as inheritance and polymorphism, which allow for code to be reused and adapted for
 different purposes.

In conclusion, both OOP and POP have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice
 between the two depends on the specific requirements of the project and the preferences 
 of the programmer. However, OOP is generally a more powerful and flexible programming paradigm 
 that is well suited to large, complex applications.
